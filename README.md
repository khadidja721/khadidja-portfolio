# Inspiring Message Generator ✨

This is a simple JavaScript project that generates a new inspiring message every time you run it.

## How it works

The message is made up of 3 random parts:
- A **quality** (like patience or 
courage)
- An **action** (like "opens invisible doors")
- An **advice** (like "Don’t give up now.")

Each time you run the script, you get a new inspiring message.

## Example output


## How to run it

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed  
2. Open a terminal in this folder  
3. Run the following command:

```bash
node message.js
